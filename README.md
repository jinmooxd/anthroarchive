# ARKive Reimagined

A virtual sanctuary for extinct species and erased habitats—an interactive, scroll-based website that explores digital remembrance through absence, impermanence, and decay.

## Background

Growing up in Myanmar and Vietnam, I witnessed firsthand the environmental degradation that plagues Southeast Asia. After years of cleanup efforts that felt like Sisyphus rolling a boulder uphill, I began to wonder if there was a way to truly change unsustainable behaviors. This question propelled me into environmental and data science research, and eventually led me to explore the intersection of technology and environmental remediation.

As a computer science major with a minor in environmental studies, this project represents my final work for **ENST205: Reckoning with the Anthropocene**. ARKive Reimagined unites my technical craft with the values I grew up with: repair, remembrance, and respect for the nonhuman world.

## Project Overview

ARKive Reimagined is a coded interactive website that functions as a virtual sanctuary for extinct species and lost ecosystems. Rather than displaying data or statistics, the site offers an intimate, interactive experience that captures absence: images that fade, sounds that dissolve, and text that vanishes as you scroll.

**Core Question:** What does digital remembrance look like when there is nothing left to remember?

This project exposes the tension between visibility and disappearance in Anthropocene culture: the more we digitize the lost world, the further we drift from it.

## Theoretical Foundations

The project integrates insights from:

- **The Anthropocene Project — Gigapixel Essay** — exploring the scale and impact of human activity on Earth
- **Ursula Heise, "From Arks to ARKive.org"** — critique of archives as narrative forms shaping biodiversity perception
- **de Massol de Rebetz, "Remembrance Day for Lost Species"** — ethics of mourning and public ritual online
- **Donna Haraway, "Tentacular Thinking"** — the idea of "making-kin" with nonhuman entities, inspiring relational rather than hierarchical navigation

Together, these texts inform a design philosophy of **ethical slowness and participation**: the user becomes part of the memorial act rather than a passive observer.

## Features

### Landing Screen
An empty background with fading text inviting the visitor to "enter the archive."

### Archive Flow
As users scroll, new fragments appear and then dissolve—echoing how memory surfaces and fades. Each entry features:
- Images blurred beyond recognition
- Short pieces of text
- Ambient sounds that fade with scrolling

### Reflection Prompt
A final textbox where visitors can type a thought that briefly appears before fading, simulating impermanence and the ephemeral nature of memory.

## Design Philosophy

The aesthetic emphasizes:
- **Silence** — space for contemplation
- **Space** — breathing room rather than information density
- **Decay** — visual and interactive elements that fade and disappear

The site uses subtle motion and responsive layout to function across different screen sizes, creating an intimate experience that honors what has been lost.

## Timeline

- **Week 1:** Storyboard and gather assets (images, texts, sounds)
- **Week 2:** Build website (HTML structure and CSS design system)
- **Week 3:** Add animation and interaction logic; conduct peer testing for mood and usability
- **Week 4:** Write and refine reflection essay
- **Week 5:** Deploy on GitHub Pages and finalize documentation for portfolio

## Development

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. For local development with a server (recommended):
   ```bash
   # Using Python
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js
   npx http-server
   ```

### Deployment

The project is deployed on GitHub Pages. To update:
1. Push changes to the `main` branch
2. GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild the site

## Critical Reflection

The project analyzes how code, interaction, and temporality can evoke the emotional dimensions of extinction, extending narrative methods into digital media. It explores the paradox of digital preservation: can we truly remember what we've lost through the very medium that distances us from it?
