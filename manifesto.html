                <h1>Manifesto</h1>
                <p>Not a nostalgic return, and not a scientific ledger, but a reckoning—an encounter with sixteen lives and lineages that once pulsed through forests, oceans, rivers, islands, tundra, and sky. They did not disappear quietly. They were pushed, hunted, erased, engineered out of existence by expanding economies, warming atmospheres, and the unrelenting pressure of human desire. To stand before these species is to stand before the evidence of choices, and the shadows of choices we continue to make.</p>
                <p>We present the Great Auk, Steller’s Sea Cow, the Passenger Pigeon, and the Carolina Parakeet not as quaint cautionary tales, but as mirrors. These were beings that lived in multitudes—flocks that darkened the sky, herds that shaped grasslands, colonies that fed entire ocean cycles. Their bodies fed us, fueled us, decorated us. Their absence now feeds our myths of innocence. In their extinction is a record of extractive logic that did not end with them; it merely shifted targets.</p>
                <p>We include the Baiji, the Tecopa Pupfish, the San Marcos Gambusia—species whose worlds were narrowed down to polluted rivers, engineered springs, and industrial waterways. They remind us that extinction is rarely dramatic. More often, it is the slow constriction of possibility: a bit more silt, a new drainage canal, a louder propeller, a chemical that settles into tissue. These are losses so incremental that they almost feel natural, until one day, they are absolute.</p>
                <p>From the Bramble Cay Melomys to the Golden Toad, we enter the terrain of climate collapse. These animals lived on edges—on cays barely above sea level, in cloud forests hovering on delicate moisture gradients. Their erasure is a preview of the climate futures we have already set in motion. When global systems shift, small worlds die first. The melomys and the toad are not outliers; they are the opening notes of a much larger elegy.</p>
                <p>And then the Woolly Mammoth, the Thylacine, the Heath Hen, the Pyrenean Ibex—species whose stories now circulate through the speculative realm of de-extinction. They complicate our grief. They challenge our fixation on technological salvation. Their presence here is not a promise that we can reverse what has been done, but a reminder that resurrection fantasies can distract from the far more urgent task of protecting what remains. These animals ask us: Is bringing something back the same as restoring a world? When a species disappears, what else disappears with it—behaviors, relationships, ecologies, cosmologies, meanings?</p>
                <p>This exhibition is not about nature as a pristine elsewhere. It is about entanglement. Every extinction displayed here is also a human story: of hunger, ambition, industry, fear, power, and imagination. We are not separate observers; we are implicated authors. The extinction record is not a natural archive—it is a cultural one.</p>
                <p>Yet this is not a collection of endings. It is an invitation. To look closely. To feel the density of history inside a single vanished life. To understand that extinction is not a distant tragedy of the past but a living verb, unfolding now in every overheated forest, every overfished reef, every river engineered for convenience.</p>
                <p>These sixteen species are gone. Their worlds are gone.</p>
                <p>But the forces that shaped their disappearance are still shaping ours.</p>
                <p>This exhibition asks you to stay in that discomfort long enough to imagine something different: a future where remembrance becomes responsibility, where mourning becomes action, and where the archive of what we have lost becomes the catalyst for what we refuse to lose next.</p>
